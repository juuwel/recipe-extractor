# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 4, 2025

This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Recipe Extractor application.

## Information We Collect

- **Recipe Data:** When you use the application, we process recipe URLs and extract ingredients and instructions. This data is not stored by us; it is only published to your connected Notion workspace or database, which you own and control.
- **No Data Storage:** We do **not** store your recipes, extracted data, or personal information on our servers. All data is sent directly to your Notion workspace or database.
- **Authentication Data:** Currently, we do not store any authentication tokens. In the future, if we implement OAuth or similar authentication flows, we may need to securely store an access token to connect to your Notion workspace. This will be updated in this policy if implemented.
- **No Personal Data:** We do not intentionally collect personal information such as your name, email, or contact details.

## How We Use Information

- To extract and store recipe data as requested by you.
- To provide and improve the functionality of the application.

## Data Sharing

- We do not sell or share your data with third parties.
- Data may be shared with third-party services (e.g., Notion) only as necessary to provide the requested functionality.

## Data Security

- We use reasonable measures to protect your data, including secure storage of API keys and database credentials.
- You are responsible for safeguarding your own API keys and credentials.

## Your Choices

- You may disconnect your Notion account or delete your data at any time by removing your credentials or database entries.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in this document.
